# removeable-bootstrap-datepicker

This is a fork of Stefan Petre's [bootstrap-datepicker](http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-datepicker/) that adds a new method:

**.datepicker('remove')**

which removes datepicker events and elements from the DOM.

## Why?

eternicode has [another popular fork](https://github.com/eternicode/bootstrap-datepicker) of Petre's code that adds a remove method, but it is much more feature-rich, and the codebase is nearly 3x the size of the original.
