# bootstrap-datepicker

This is a fork of Stefan Petre's [bootstrap-datepicker](http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-datepicker/). There are a few improvements over the original:

* A new **remove** method, which removes datepicker events and DOM elements
* The code has been cleaned up for consistency, readability, and extensibility

See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for specifics.

## Why?

There is already a [popular fork](https://github.com/eternicode/bootstrap-datepicker) of Petre's code, but it is three times the size of the original library. I'd like to improve the quality of the library without increasing complexity or file size.
