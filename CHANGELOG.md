## (unreleased)

* Added a **remove** method, which unbinds datepicker events and removes datepicker DOM elements
* Minor cleanup around the codebase
* Options passed in with data attributes now use hyphenated option names
* If the datepicker is bound to an input and you click in the input twice, the datepicker will no longer be hidden automatically
